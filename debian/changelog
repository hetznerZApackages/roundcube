      + header delimiters handling has been fixed in 0.5.
        Closes: #603489.
  * Don't assign "skins" directory to www-data. Closes: #612552.
  * Add instructions on how to install and upgrade when not using

    misleading. Closes: #612511.
  * Fix MySQL indexes if upgrading from 0.5-2 or lesser. Closes: #610725.
  * Rework how symlinks work. The only directory to use is
    /var/lib/roundcube. We use symlink from /usr/share/roundcube to
    /var/lib/roundcube and not the other way. Moreover, plugins and skins
    are also symlinked. A user should be able to add plugins and skins in
    /var/lib/roundcube while default ones are in

roundcube (0.5-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * If 0.3.1 was installed from scratch, upgrade does not work on MySQL
    and PostgreSQL because we try to create an index which already
    exists. With SQLite, the error is ignored, no fix needed. When using
    PostgreSQL, fix this by dropping the index if it already
    exists. Nothing similar seems to exist with MySQL. Therefore, just
    don't create the index. We need to handle this later. See bug
    #610725. Not closing.

       now correctly states to use dpkg-reconfigure roundcube-core.
       Closes: #608977.
     + Update SQL commands to use to upgrade database.
       That also closes: #602922. Unfortunately, the user may get some
       harmless error messages because there is no way to know if
       0.3.1 was installed from scratch or upgraded from 0.3.
     + Update dependencies to match INSTALL file. Only exception is the
       use of Mail_Mime 1.8.0 in place of 1.8.1 which is not available in
       Debian. We depends on jQuery 1.4.2 because 1.4.4 is not available in
       Debian.
     + All folders are correctly checked since 0.4. Closes: #552430.
     + Also, closes: #553194 since it seems to have been fixed too.
     + There is also the possibility to not top-quote since 0.4.
       Closes: #491063.
     + Closes: #602144. Also fixed.
  * Move .htaccess to /etc/roundcube and use a symlink (Closes: #591369).
